# Mautic community portal
Mautic's community portal is the place where we organize everything within the project that relates to governance and community.

Whether you want to participate in a vote for a new member for the Mautic council,  get involved in a debate about a feature,  find out where your local meetup groups are,  or just learn a bit more about how decisions are made in this open source project,  this is the place for you!

Log in at [community.mautic.org](https://community.mautic.org) with your Mautic community credentials from the forums/website if you're already registered, or create a new account.

##  Contributing to the portal

The community portal runs on the open source software [Decidim](https://decidim.org).

Code changes are accepted via pull requests.  If you find a bug please report it via issues.

If you would like to help with managing the portal itself, claiming membership or any other problems, please reach out via #community on [Slack](https://mautic.org/slack).
